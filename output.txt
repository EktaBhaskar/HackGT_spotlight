hey y'all I'm Patrick Haggerty with Roi training and in this video I'm going to show you how to easily create a Google Cloud Storage bucket. now I have a Google Document where I collect a lot of links for Google Cloud that I find useful you can find that file at tinyurl.com / Roi gcp links in that file in the data section I actually have a subsection on cloud storage there's a lot of nice links related to cloud storage and how it works starting with the main cloud storage documentation homepage visiting that will give you a nice overview of what cloud storage is how it works and. so you'll see there's a subsection that would be a nice follow on to this video on actually creating podcasts to create a bucket I need a Google Cloud project I'm going into my project here I can go to the main navigation menu and cloud storage will be found right below compute in these stories section let me click on storage it'll show any buckets I have right now and I can click create bucket to build a new one the first question you will have to answer is you'll have to come up with the. the name of a bucket the bucket name needs to be globally unique so you might have to play with it a little bit to see if you can come up with a global unique name video demos taken by somebody else video demo you know 4242 that's free next question you'll have to answer is your location where you store the data there's three choices I can store it in a particular Google Cloud region like us Central Juan and Iowa. or u.s. east one and South Carolina or something like that your next choice really is multi-regional multi-regional you can pick a particular part of the world if I pick you us for example what Google guarantees is it'll be stored in at least two regions in the United States at least 100 miles apart if it's important to you to know exactly which two regions that's what jewelry Jules does I can pick America's and now I know it's going to have a copy in Iowa and. and South Carolina a little more expensive but higher on the availability and right if you don't know just go with regional goes Regional I'm going to put a new messenger one next decision you'll have to make is a storage class standard storage class is hot data that means data that you're frequently accessing a regional story Regional storage bucket with hot data is going to be about 20 bucks a terabyte notice accessing is free nearline cold line archive are all Force. of them we Access Data access it about once a month near line access it about once a quarter cold mine hope you never have to access it again or certainly no more than once a year archival the nearline cold mind archive are all cheaper on the storage fronts but they come with an access penalty archive is only a dollar twenty a terabyte the store but to access that it would be 50 bucks a terabyte to access so that's why nearline Cold line archive don't make. sense for Hot Nigga frequently accessed data when in doubt go standard next decision you'll have to make do you want every file to have its own permissions Access Control list that's fine grain that's the default or would you like all the files in the bucket to have the exact same level of access you can make that decision and you have up to 90 days to change your mind. last we have some more advanced options how is it encrypted retention labels couple other things you might go read the documentation for that once you're finished with your selections hit create it will take just a couple of moments and you will have a nice shiny new storage bucket ready to store your files I'm Patrick Haggerty with Roi training I hope you've enjoyed this video. calculus time calculus or just calc also known as the biggest barrier to cross over to the pure math zone is the mathematical study of change specifically it means change over the course of something most often this something is time but.
